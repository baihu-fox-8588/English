# Happy Accidents: A Brief History of Unexpected Inventions

Some of the most notable inventions of all time came about by accident.
<!-- 有些最著名的發明是在意外發生之後才完成的 -->

A research sample mistakenly left open resulted in the discovery of penicillin, the first antibiotic.
<!-- 一個研究樣本被錯誤地開起了，結果發現了青黴素，第一個抗生素 -->

When a Swiss engineer happened to get some plant seeds stuck to his clothes after going for a walk, it inspired him to invent Velcro.
<!-- 一位瑞士工程師在散步時，衣服上黏了一些植物種子，啟發他發明了魔鬼氈 -->

Inventing the microwave oven likewise required a little luck.
<!-- 發明微波爐也需要一點幸運 -->

During World War II, Percy Spencer was using magnetrons to build radar systems for the US military.
<!-- 在二戰的時候，珀西·斯賓塞用磁線機來為美國軍隊建立雷達系統 -->

However, after standing close to a magnetron one day, he realized that a chocolate bar he had in his pocket had completely melted.
<!-- 然而，一天在磁線機旁邊坐著，他發現在口袋裡的巧克力條已經完全融化了 -->

That was how Spencer figured out that the microwaves emitted by a magnetron could be used to cook food, and the microwave oven is now present in kitchens around the world.
<!-- 就這樣斯賓塞發現，磁控管發射的微波可以用來烹調食物，如今微波爐已經出現在世界各地的廚房 -->

Decades earlier, Wilhelm Röntgen was conducting experiments with cathode rays when he stumbled on a type of "invisible light" that could pass through many types of materials.
<!-- 幾十年前，威廉·倫琴在進行陰極射線實驗時偶然發現了一種可以穿過多種材料的「看不見的光」 -->

He soon proved that this light could show the bones inside the human body by taking an X-ray photo of his wife's hand.
<!-- 他很快就透過為妻子的手拍攝X光照片證明了這種光可以顯示出人體內部的骨骼 -->

Since then, X-rays used for medical diagnoses have saved millions of lives.
<!-- 之後，X光用於醫學診斷已經償還了許多人的生命 -->

If you've ever seen a car's windshield break, you might know that windshields don't break into large, sharp pieces.
<!-- 如果你曾經看過汽車擋風玻璃破碎，你可能知道擋風玻璃不會破碎成大塊、鋒利的碎片 -->

That's because they're made of safety glass, which was invented by the French chemist Edouard Benedictus when he accidentally dropped a glass flask that he had become coated in a plastic solution.
<!-- 這是因為它們是由安全玻璃製成的，這種玻璃是由法國化學家愛德華·本尼迪克特斯發明的，當時他不小心掉落了一個沾滿塑膠溶液的玻璃燒瓶 -->

Much to his surprise, while the glass did break, the pieces stuck together.
<!-- 令他驚訝的是，玻璃雖然碎了，但碎片卻黏在了一起 -->

Soon after, Benedictus was able to use this observation to develop safety glass.
<!-- 不久之後，本尼迪克特斯利用這項觀察發明了安全玻璃 -->

In 1856, William Henry Perkin was attempting to synthesize some medicine.
<!-- 1856 年，威廉·亨利·珀金嘗試合成某種藥物 -->

The attempt failed, but as Perkin was cleaning the bottle he had used with alcohol, he noticed the bright purple color of the resulting mixture.
<!-- 嘗試失敗了，但當珀金用酒精清洗用過的瓶子時，他注意到生成的混合物呈現明亮的紫色 -->

Realizing that the solution could be used as a dye for fabric, he patented it and founded a company to start mass-producing it.
<!-- 他意識到該溶液可用作織物染料，因此申請了專利並成立了一家公司開始大規模生產。 -->

The dye later came to be called mauveine, after a flower of a similar color, and by 1860, the color was so popular that dresses featuring it were flying off the rack.
<!-- 這種染料後來被稱為「苯胺紫」，是以一種顏色相似的花命名的。到1860年，這種顏色已經非常流行，帶有這種顏色的洋裝供不應求，一掃而空 -->

So remember, accidents have a surprising way of leading to new creations.
<!-- 所以請記住，意外總是會以令人驚訝的方式帶來新的創造 -->

Sometimes, the greatest breakthroughs happen when we least expect them.
<!-- 有時，最大的突破發生在我們最意想不到的時候 -->
