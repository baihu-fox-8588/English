# The odd and Unexpected Consequences of Climate Change

Beyond the headlines about extreme weather, climate change is influencing our world in some strange and surprising ways, from shrinking goats to worsening allergies.
<!-- 除了有關極端天氣的新聞頭條之外，氣候變遷還以一些奇怪而令人驚訝的方式影響著我們的世界，從山羊體型縮小到過敏症狀加劇 -->

Let's explore some of these lesser-known but also important consequences of climate change.
<!-- 讓我們來探討一下氣候變遷的一些鮮為人知但同樣重要的後果 -->

## Mosquitoes on the Move

Mosquitoes-borne diseases such as dengue fever and malaria are on the rise.
<!-- 登革熱、瘧疾等由蚊子傳播的疾病日益增多。 -->

The insects have benefited from increased temperatures and humidity levels, which have allowed them to spread to areas where they previously struggled to survive.
<!-- 溫度和濕度的升高為昆蟲提供了好處，使它們能夠擴散到以前難以生存的地區 -->

For example, the tiger mosquito is now thriving in 13 European countries -- from Spain in the south to Germany in the north -- bringing substantially increased rates of dengue with it.
<!-- 例如，虎蚊現在在歐洲 13 個國家肆虐——從西班牙南部到德國北部——導致登革熱病例發病率大幅上升 -->

## Trouble in the skins

Turbulence, an already common air travel issue, is becoming an increasing concern due to warming temperatures brought on by climate change.
<!-- 亂流已經是常見的航空旅行問題，由於氣候變遷導致的氣溫升高，亂流變得越來越令人擔憂 -->

Data shows a significant global rise in serious turbulence in the past few decades, including higher levels of unpredictable and hard-to-detect clear-air turbulence.
<!-- 數據顯示，過去幾十年來，全球嚴重湍流顯著增加，包括更高水平的不可預測和難以檢測的晴空湍流 -->

This not only poses safety risks to passengers and crew members but also contributes to growing maintenance costs for airlines.
<!-- 這不僅對乘客和飛行員帶來安全風險，也會加劇航空公司維修成本 -->

Better turbulence is prediction and detection systems will be key to addressing the challenges and costs associated with this climate-driven phenomenon.
<!-- 更好的湍流預測和偵測系統將是解決與這種氣候驅動現象相關的挑戰和成本的關鍵 -->

## Lady lizards and shrinking goats

Climate breakdown is also having odd effects in the animal world.
<!-- 氣候破壞也在動物世界中有奇怪的影響 -->

For example, because of the their effects on bearded dragon eggs, higher temperatures are causing greater numbers of female bearded dragons to hatch in Australia.
<!-- 例如，由於高溫對鬃獅蜥蛋的影響，澳洲越來越多的鬃獅蜥因高溫而孵化為雌性 -->

In Italy meanwhile, goats in the Alps are shrinking because of reduction feeding and increased resting during hot periods.
<!-- 同時，在義大利，阿爾卑斯山的山羊因炎熱時期進食減少和休息時間增加而體型縮小 -->

Male coquí frogs in Puerto Rico are also getting smaller, causing them to croak at higher pitches.
<!-- 在波多黎各，雄性小樹蛙的體型也在變小，導致它們的叫聲音調變得更高 -->

## Sleepless nights and awful allergies

Closer to home, our nighttime routines are being affected.
<!--回到家，我們的夜間生活受到了影響 -->

As anyone who has spent a hot night tossing and turning knows, warm weather disrupts sleep.
<!-- 任何在炎熱的夜晚輾轉反側的人都知道，溫暖的天氣會影響睡眠 -->

In fact, scientists estimate that people could lose up to 58 hours of sleep per year by 2100 due to hot nights.
<!-- 事實上，科學家估計，到 2100 年，由於夜晚炎熱，人們每年可能會失去多達 58 小時的睡眠時間 -->

Hotter temperatures are also bad news for allergy sufferers, as they mean earlier and longer pollen seasons.
<!-- 對過敏症患者來說，氣溫升高也是個壞消息，因為這意味著花粉季節會更早、更長。 -->

Since 1990, 20 extra days have been added to the annual allergy season.
<!-- 自 1990 年起，每年的過敏季節增加了 20 天。 -->

So, as the headlines scream about floods and fires, climate change is quietly transforming our world in more surprising ways,
<!-- 因此，當新聞頭條報導洪水和火災時，氣候變遷正在以更令人驚訝的方式悄悄改變著我們的世界 -->

But like those more obvious effects, these smaller impacts also pose challenges to human health, wildlife, and industry.
<!-- 但與那些更明顯的影響一樣，這些較小的影響也對人類健康、野生動物和工業構成了挑戰 -->
