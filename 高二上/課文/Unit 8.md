# Elephant Abuse：The Thai Tourist Industry's Dark Secret

Every year, Thailand sees millions of tourists, many of whom have a lot of fun riding elephants.
<!-- 每年泰國接待數百萬遊客，其中許多人都以騎大象為樂 -->

In fact, this activity if often the hightlight of a visitor's vacation, and these rides bring a lot of money into the Thai economy.
<!-- 事實上，這項活動常常是遊客假期的亮點，這些騎乘活動為泰國經濟帶來大量收入 -->

However, there is a dark side to elephant tourism that would horrify many travelers.
<!-- 然而，大象旅遊業有著令許多遊客感到恐懼的黑暗面 -->

Due to high demand in Thailand's tourism industry, the illegal trade of young elephants has developed.
<!-- 由於泰國旅遊業的高需求，非法販賣幼象的行為也隨之發展 -->

Being highly social creatures in their natural habitat, elephants often travel great distances in herds which are led by female.
<!-- 在自然棲息地中，大象是高度群居的動物，常常由雌象帶領整個象群長途遷徙 -->

Unfortunately, a number of young wild elephants are lured away from their mothers and into traps by brutal trappers.
<!-- 不幸的是，許多野生幼象被殘暴的捕獵者誘騙離開母親，落入陷阱 -->

Any females from the herd that try to protect their innocent babies may be shot mercilessly.
<!-- 任何試圖保護無辜幼象的母象都可能被無情射殺 -->

The elephants that fall victim to the traps are then sold to tour operators.
<!-- 落入陷阱的大象隨後被賣給旅遊經營者 -->

That is when the real horror begins, as the elephants are often violently abused.
<!-- 這時真正的恐怖才開始，因為大象經常遭受暴力虐待 -->

These young elephants are confined in very small cages.
<!-- 這些幼象被關在非常小的籠子裡 -->

Futuremore, they are beaten without mercy for days and even struck with sharp nails.
<!-- 此外，他們被無情毆打數天，甚至被尖銳的釘子刺傷 -->

Such psychological torture and physical abuse, both of which cause extreme suffering, are committed in order to make them obedient to their human trainers.
<!-- 這些造成極度痛苦的心理折磨和身體虐待，都是為了讓他們服從人類訓練師 -->

Once the elephants are tamed, they are forced into a life of slavery.
<!-- 一旦大象被馴服，他們就被迫過著奴隸般的生活 -->

Many of them are made to carry people on their backs at tourist attraction and elephant camps.
<!-- 許多大象被迫在旅遊景點和大象營地背負遊客 -->

Since an elephant's spine is vulnerable to pressure from above, carrying heavy tourists for hours every day can lead to painful, permanent back injuries.
<!-- 由於大象的脊椎對上方的壓力很敏感，每天長時間背負重重的遊客會導致痛苦的永久性背部傷害 -->

What's more, they are denied an adequate amount of food and water, which further contributes to their exhaustion.
<!-- 更糟的是，他們被剝奪足夠的食物和水，這進一步加劇了他們的疲憊 -->

Worse still, they are beaten as they work; their flesh is struck with bullhooks.
<!-- 更糟糕的是，他們在工作時還要挨打，他們的肉體被象鉤擊打 -->

On average, more than 13 million tourists ride elephants in Thailand every year.
<!-- 平均每年有超過1300萬遊客在泰國騎大象 -->

This puts money in the pockets of those who capture and take advantage of them, which allows the cruel elephant trade to continue.
<!-- 這為那些捕捉和利用大象的人帶來收入，使得殘酷的大象貿易得以持續 -->

Supply never comes without demand, and it is high time that we dealt with the roots of this problem.
<!-- 有需求才有供應，現在是時候處理這個問題的根源了 -->

When you visit Thailand, avoid companies profiting from elephant tourism.
<!-- 當你訪問泰國時，請避開從大象旅遊中獲利的公司 -->

As an alternative, visit one of Thailand's three national parks where wild elephants roam free.
<!-- 作為替代方案，可以參觀泰國三個讓野生大象自由漫步的國家公園之一 -->

There, you can take pleasure in seeing these complex, intelligent animals as they happily go about their lives in peace.
<!-- 在那裡，你可以愉快地觀賞這些複雜、聰明的動物和平快樂地生活 -->
