# Bodies Speak Louder Than Words

The theory that spoken words account for only about seven percent of communication involving emotions may surprise many people.
<!-- 言語溝通在情感表達中只占7%的理論可能會讓許多人感到驚訝 -->

This was first proposed by Dr. Albert Mehrabian, a famous psychology professor.
<!-- 這個理論最初是由著名心理學教授艾伯特·梅拉比安博士提出的 -->

Accounding to his studies, we achieve about 55% of our emotional communication with our bodies, for they typically demonstrate our true feelings and what we're thinking.
<!-- 根據他的研究，我們約55%的情感溝通是通過身體語言完成的，因為身體語言通常能展現我們真實的感受和想法 -->

Therefore, understanding the people's well is helpful in determining whether or not someone is telling the truth.
<!-- 因此，好好理解人們的身體語言有助於判斷某人是否在說實話 -->

When people are lying, there are usually three telltales signs: making stiff body movements, touching or scratching themselves, and making eye movements.
<!-- 當人們說謊時，通常有三個明顯的跡象：僵硬的身體動作、觸摸或搔抓自己，以及眼睛的移動 -->

Typically, liars exhibit fewer arm and hand gestures.
<!-- 通常，說謊者較少做手臂和手部動作 -->

When they do make such gestures, their movements are usually stiff, and their hands tend to stay close to the body rather than move in an outward direction.
<!-- 當他們做這些動作時，動作通常很僵硬，手傾向於靠近身體而不是向外移動 -->

Moreover, liars often can't help but touch or scratch their faces, their necks, or behind their ears.
<!-- 此外，說謊者經常忍不住觸摸或搔抓他們的臉、脖子或耳後 -->

They sometimes rub their eyes without being conscious of it as well.
<!-- 他們有時也會不自覺地揉眼睛 -->

Whether people are telling falsehoods or not can also be detected by observing how their eyes move as they speak.
<!-- 通過觀察人們說話時眼睛的移動方向，也可以判斷他們是否在說謊 -->

When right-handed people say true things, their eyes move to their left.
<!-- 當右撇子說實話時，他們的眼睛會向左移動 -->

In contrast, when they are lying or being "creative" with the truth, their eyes tend to drift toward their right.
<!-- 相反，當他們說謊或對事實進行"創造性"表達時，他們的眼睛傾向於向右移動 -->

The reverse is true for left-handed people.
<!-- 對於左撇子來說則相反 -->

Another significant type of telling body language is connected to love.
<!-- 另一種重要的身體語言與愛情有關 -->

In the case of romantic feelings, people's bodies subconsciously provide an indication for someone to whom they are attracted.
<!-- 在浪漫感覺方面，人們的身體會下意識地表現出對他們所喜歡的人的暗示 -->

Under the circumstances, their eyes do must of the "talking".
<!-- 在這種情況下，他們的眼睛會做大部分的"交談" -->

Initially, they may look glance at a person from a distance and for just slightly longer than normal.
<!-- 一開始，他們可能會從遠處看著某人，注視時間比平常稍長 -->

Afterward, they may look away and finally rest their eyes on him or her again for an even longer period.
<!-- 之後，他們可能會移開視線，最後再次將目光停留在那個人身上更長時間 -->

Futuremore, they automatically track or repeat his or her actions without even knowing it.
<!-- 此外，他們會不自覺地跟隨或模仿對方的動作 -->

If he or she sits back, they will follow suit.
<!-- 如果對方往後靠，他們也會跟著往後靠 -->

If that person takes a sip of water, they will probably do the same.
<!-- 如果那個人喝一口水，他們可能也會跟著喝水 -->

Aside from copying behavior, they often can't help pointing their feet and shoulders toward the one they adore or standing closer to the object of their affection than the other.
<!-- 除了模仿行為外，他們常常會不自覺地將腳和肩膀朝向他們喜歡的人，或是站得比其他人更靠近他們傾慕的對象 -->

All of the previously mentioned points reveal the idea that one of the best methods for interpreting people's thoughts and emotions is to pay attention to their body language.
<!-- 以上所提到的所有要點都表明，解讀人們思想和情感的最佳方法之一就是注意他們的身體語言 -->

By understanding the signals that people send out with their body language, we may interact in a more meaningful way with our fellow human beings.
<!-- 通過理解人們通過身體語言發出的信號，我們可以與他人進行更有意義的互動 -->

Best of all, we can do it without even saying a single word!
<!-- 最棒的是，我們不用說一句話就能做到這一點！ -->
