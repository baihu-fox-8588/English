# Biomimetic Architecture: Nature-Inspired Design

Biomimetic architecture is a field of design that looks to nature for inspiration.
<!-- 仿生建築是一種從大自然中尋找靈感的設計領域 -->

The term biomimetic comes from the Greek words bio ("life:) and mimetic ("imitation").
<!-- 仿生學這個術語源自於希臘語bio（“生命”）和mimetic（“模仿”） -->

In architecture, this means designing buildings and structures that mimic natural forms and processes for the purpose of solving complex human problems.
<!-- 在建築領域，這意味著設計模仿自然形態和過程的建築物和結構，以解決複雜的人類問題 -->

The concept of biomimetic in design has been around for centuries.
<!-- 設計中的仿生概念已經存在了幾個世紀 -->

However, the term biomimetic architecture became more widely known in the 20th century, in part due to advances in science and technology.
<!-- 然而，仿生建築這個術語在 20 世紀變得更加廣為人知，部分原因是科學與技術的進步 -->

Today, the field of biomimetic architecture is growing rapidly, as architects seek new ways to create aesthetically appealing structures that are also sustainable.
<!-- 如今，隨著建築師不斷尋求新方法來創造美觀且永續的建築，仿生建築領域正在迅速發展 -->

Indeed, sustainability is one of the main benefits of biomimetic architecture.
<!-- 的確，永續性是仿生建築的主要優點之一 -->

By imitating nature, architects can create buildings that are more energy efficient and environmentally friendly.
<!-- 透過模仿大自然，建築師可以建造更節能、更環保的建築 -->

For example, termite mounds maintain constant internal temperatures through natural ventilation systems.
<!-- 例如，白蟻丘透過自然通風系統維持恆定的內部溫度 -->

Therefore, buildings with designs based on this aspect of termite mounds -- such as Council House 2 in Melbourne, Australia -- employ passive cooling and heating strategies instead of resource-heavy air-conditioning systems.
<!-- 因此，根據白蟻丘的這項特點而設計的建築物（例如澳洲墨爾本的市政廳 2 號）採用被動冷卻和加熱策略，而不是資源密集的空調系統 -->

This approach not only lowers energy costs but also makes the buildings more sustainable over the long term.
<!-- 這種方法不僅降低了能源成本，而且使建築物的長期永續性更加加強 -->

Biomimetic architecture can be found around the world.
<!-- 仿生建築可以在世界各地找到 -->

One well-known example in Taiwan is the Kaohsiung Music Center.
<!-- 在台灣，一個知名的例子是高雄音樂中心。 -->

The center features forms that mimic elements of the ocean environment, such as coral reefs, dolphins, and waves.
<!-- 該中心的設計融入了模仿海洋環境元素的造型，如珊瑚礁、海豚和海浪 -->

The design makes highly effective use of natural light, reducing the need for artificial light sources.
<!-- 該設計充分利用自然光，減少對人工光源的需求 -->

The Milwaukee Art Museum's Quadracci Pavilion in the US likewise employs biomimicry to make better use of natural light.
<!-- 美國密爾瓦基藝術博物館的 Quadracci Pavilion 同樣運用了仿生設計，以更有效地利用自然光 -->

Specifically, the pavilion is topped by an enormous pair of steel birdlike "wings" that can be opened or closed to regulate the amount of sumlight entering the building.
<!-- 具體而言，該展館頂部有一對巨大的鋼製鳥翼狀結構，能夠開合以調節進入建築內的陽光量 -->

The Eden Project in Cornwall, England, is another notable example of biomimetic architecture.
<!-- 英國康沃爾郡的伊甸園計畫是仿生建築的另一個著名例子 -->

The project's large, domed greenhouses efficiently house different plant species from various climates.
<!-- 該計畫的大型圓頂溫室可以有效地容納來自不同氣候的不同植物種類 -->

The greenhouses are similar in structure to soap bubbles and were made using a special material that's lighter and stronger than glass.
<!-- 這些溫室的結構與肥皂泡相似，採用比玻璃更輕更堅固的特殊材料製成 -->

This design allows for maximum strength and surface area with minimal materials and weight.
<!-- 這種設計可以用最少的材料和重量來實現最大的強度和表面積 -->

These innovative examples show the amazing potential of biomimetic architecture.
<!-- 這些創新的例子顯示了仿生建築的巨大潛力。 -->

By putting inspirations from nature into practice, it enables the creation of beautiful and sustainable structures that people can enjoy for years to come.
<!-- 透過將大自然的靈感付諸實踐，可以創造出美麗且可持續的建築，供人們在未來的幾年中享受 -->
