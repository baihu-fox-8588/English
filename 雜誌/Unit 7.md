# All About Olives: The Secrets of Athena's Gift

From the ancient groves of Greece to kitchen tables worldwide, the olive is one fascinating fruit.
<!-- 從希臘的古老樹林到世界各地的餐桌，橄欖是一種令人著迷的水果 -->

Celebrated for its flavorful flesh and oil, it carries a rich history of symbolism and practical uses.
<!-- 因其風味濃郁的肉質和油脂而廣受讚譽，它承載著豐富的象徵意義和實用價值的歷史 -->

The olive tree is a powerful symbol in Greek mythology.
<!-- 希臘神話中的橄欖樹是一個強大的象徵 -->

Stories credit Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom, with gifting the first olive tree to the citizens of Athens.
<!-- 故事認為，希臘智慧女神雅典娜將第一棵橄欖樹贈予雅典公民 -->

To this day, in fact, a tree that's said to be descended from Athena's gift still stands atop the Acropolis.
<!-- 事實上，直到今天，一棵據說是雅典娜賜予的樹仍然矗立在雅典衛城的頂端 -->

Symbolizing victory, wisdom, and prosperity, olive trees were so valued in Athens that the city even decorated its coins with images of olive branches.
<!-- 表示勝利、智慧和繁榮的橄欖樹在雅典中如此重要，雅典城還用橄欖枝繪製了金錢上的圖像 -->

More broadly, the olive tree and its fruit have come to represent peace and hope due to their role in stories from the Bible.
<!-- 更廣泛地說，橄欖樹及其果實因為在《聖經》故事中的角色，逐漸象徵和平與希望 -->

The most famous of these stories is that of the dove returning to Noah's ark with an olive leaf, thus marking the end of the Flood.
<!-- 其中最著名的故事是鴿子叼著橄欖葉飛回諾亞方舟，象徵著大洪水的結束 -->

But interestingly, the olive branch's symbolism extends well beyond mythology and religion.
<!-- 有趣的是，橄欖枝的象徵意義遠遠超越了神話和宗教範疇 -->

In 1969, Neil Armstrong left a golden olive branch on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission -- a gesture intended to show humanity's desire for universal peace.
<!-- 1969年，尼爾·阿姆斯壯在阿波羅11號任務中將一枚金色橄欖枝留在月球上，這一舉動象徵著人類對於世界和平的渴望 -->

Just as their symbolism has spread around the world, so have olive trees themselves.
<!-- 正如橄欖的象徵意義傳遍全球，橄欖樹本身也在世界各地廣為種植。 -->

Favoring warm climates, hundreds of varieties can now be found growing in countries as widely spread as Chile, New Zealand, South Africa, and Pakistan.
<!-- 橄欖樹喜愛溫暖的氣候，目前在智利、新西蘭、南非和巴基斯坦等地分佈廣泛，數百種品種遍及全球。 -->

Both the unripe green and ripe black fruits are packed with vitamin E and antioxidants, giving them anti-inflammatory and potentially cancer-fighting properties.
<!-- 未成熟的綠橄欖和成熟的黑橄欖都富含維生素E和抗氧化物，具備抗炎和潛在抗癌的功效 -->

They're most closely associated with the Mediterranean diet, in which they're brined, salted, stuffed, or turned into olive oil to add a burst of flavor.
<!-- 他們與地中海飲食最為相關，通常被醃漬、鹽漬、填充，或製成橄欖油，用來增添一絲風味 -->

And speaking of olive oil -- also known as "liquid gold" -- it boasts a surprising number of applications outside the kitchen.
<!-- 提到橄欖油──也被稱為「液體黃金」──它在廚房之外擁有意想不到的多種應用 -->

Mix it with a dash of sugar or sea salt, and you've got a gentle skin scrub.
<!-- 加入少許糖或海鹽，就可以製成溫和的去角質膏 -->

Applied to a cloth, it can be used to being out a beautiful shine on wooden furniture.
<!-- 塗抹在布上，可以用來讓木質家具展現美麗的光澤 -->

And if your dog's paws are looking dry, try massaging them with a few drops of olive oil to provide relief.
<!-- 如果你的狗的腳掌乾燥，可以嘗試用幾滴橄欖油按摩，來緩解情況 -->

Clearly, olives are far from just a strangely salty fruit.
<!-- 顯然，橄欖遠遠不只是個奇怪的鹹水果 -->

With their many uses and rich history, they're also a health-giving, peace-bringing, beauty-boosting, paw-soothing gift from the gods.
<!-- 憑藉其多樣的用途和悠久的歷史，它們亦是一份神賜的健康之源、和平之使、美麗之助，以及舒緩犬掌乾燥的寶貴禮物 -->
