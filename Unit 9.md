# Mazu Mania：A Great Pilgrimage That Unifies the People

Every year, hundreds of thousands of people gather in central Taiwan to participate in what is known as the Mazu pilgrimage.
<!-- 每年，數十萬人聚集在台灣中部參加所謂的媽祖進香活動 -->

This religious event has become one of the world's largest pilgrimages, with millions of people taking part in it.
<!-- 這個宗教活動已成為世界上最大的朝聖活動之一，有數百萬人參與其中 -->

The festivities do not end until the participants have celebrated for nine days and journeyed over 300 kilometers in central Taiwan.
<!-- 慶典活動持續九天，參與者在台灣中部行進超過300公里才結束 -->

Undoubtedly, the Mazu pilgrimage is a can't-miss event for visitors to Taiwan.
<!-- 毫無疑問，媽祖進香是遊客來台灣不容錯過的活動 -->

The pilgrimage, which honors the sea goddess Mazu, sets out from Dajia's Zhenlan Temple around her birthday, the twenty-third day of the third month on Taiwan's lunar calendar.
<!-- 這次進香活動是為了紀念海神媽祖，在農曆三月二十三日媽祖誕辰前後從大甲鎮瀾宮出發 -->

The exact date and time, which vary from year to year, are determined earlier.
<!-- 確切的日期和時間每年都不同，會提前決定 -->

During the Lantern Festival, temple authorities cast two half-moonshaped wooden blocks to decide the actual schedule.
<!-- 在元宵節期間，廟方會擲筊決定實際的行程安排 -->

At the chosen time, some 200,000 pilgrims set out from the Zhenlan Temple on foot and visit more than 100 temples over the course of nine days.
<!-- 在選定的時間，約20萬信眾從鎮瀾宮徒步出發，在九天內參訪超過100座廟宇 -->

They are accompanied every step of the way by a statue of Mazu, which is carried in a sedan chair.
<!-- 媽祖神像全程乘坐轎子陪伴信眾 -->

Although the pilgrims' strength may wane during the long journey, never do their passion and dedication fade.
<!-- 雖然信眾在長途跋涉中體力可能減弱，但他們的熱情和奉獻精神從未減退 -->

Apart from being a chance for people to show their devotion to the goddess, this annual festival is a spectacular and heart-warming event.
<!-- 除了是人們表達對女神虔誠的機會外，這個年度盛會也是一場壯觀而溫馨的活動 -->

The gathering in front of the Zhenlan Temple before the pilgrimage begins is a scene like no other.
<!-- 進香開始前在鎮瀾宮前的聚集場面是無與倫比的 -->

Throngs of people fill the streets, while the explosive sounds of drums, horns, fireworks, and firecrackers pierce the air.
<!-- 人群擠滿街道，鑼鼓、喇叭、煙火和鞭炮的爆裂聲響徹雲霄 -->

When the statue of Mazu finally emerges from the temple in her sedan chair, the crowd surround her, excited to send her off on her long journey.
<!-- 當媽祖神像最終乘坐轎子從廟裡出來時，群眾圍繞在她周圍，興奮地為她的長途旅程送行 -->

Along the route, millions of people also join in the celebration and come out to receive her blessings.
<!-- 沿途還有數百萬人加入慶典，出來接受媽祖的祝福 -->

Some even kneel or lie face down on the pavement to allow the sedan chair to pass over them, which symbolizes their hope for good luck.
<!-- 有些人甚至跪下或趴在地上讓轎子從身上越過，象徵祈求好運 -->

In the meantime, locals show their hospitality by enthusiastically offering free food, washing facilities, and accommodations to passing pilgrims.
<!-- 同時，當地居民熱情地為經過的信眾提供免費食物、盥洗設施和住宿，展現他們的好客之道 -->

Rarely can such generosity be seen during a religious event.
<!-- 在宗教活動中很少能見到如此慷慨的行為 -->

It reflects not only the locals' dedication to Mazu but also the warmth and humanity that are characteristic of the Taiwanese people.
<!-- 這不僅反映了當地人對媽祖的奉獻，也體現了台灣人的溫暖和人情味 -->

Over the years, the Mazu pilgrimage has transformed into more than just a religious festival, and every year it attracts all manner of people--young and old, foreign and Taiwanese.
<!-- 多年來，媽祖進香已不僅僅是宗教節慶，每年都吸引各式各樣的人參與——無論老少，不分本地外國 -->

UNESCO has even recognized Mazu beliefs and customs by designating them as aspects of a protected living culture.
<!-- 聯合國教科文組織甚至將媽祖信仰和習俗認定為受保護的活態文化 -->

For those who are looking to experience Taiwan's cultural heritage, participating in the Mazu pilgrimage is essential.
<!-- 對於想要體驗台灣文化遺產的人來說，參與媽祖進香是不可或缺的經驗 -->
